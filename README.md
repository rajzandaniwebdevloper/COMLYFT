It looks like you're working on a refactoring task for Lyft, and you're about to start the refactoring process. Here's a summary of the task and some key points to keep in mind:

**Task 2: Refactoring**

**Objective:** Refactor the codebase to reflect the new design.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Start with Understanding:** Make sure you understand the current codebase and the new design you're aiming to achieve.

2. **Plan Your Refactoring:** Have a clear plan for how you want to refactor the code. Think about how to make it more modular, readable, and extensible.

3. **Small Steps:** Refactor incrementally, focusing on manageable sections. Ensure that you maintain functionality.

4. **Use Version Control:** Create branches in your version control system (e.g., Git) to work on the refactoring without affecting the main codebase.

5. **Apply Design Principles:** Consider applying design principles like SOLID and eliminate code smells.

6. **Documentation:** Keep code comments and documentation up-to-date.

7. **Don't Worry About Unit Tests:** In this task, the focus is on refactoring, not on writing unit tests. Testing will be addressed in the next task.

8. **Review and Validate:** After each section is refactored, review your changes and validate that the functionality is preserved and improved.

9. **Commit and Push:** As you make progress, commit your changes to your branch and push them to your forked repository.

10. **Consider the Future:** Keep in mind that the purpose of this refactoring is to make it easier to add new functionality later in the program.

11. **Completion:** Think of the result of this task as a draft that you will refine later in the next tasks.

Please note that refactoring is an essential practice in software development to maintain code quality and reduce technical debt. It's about making continuous improvements to the codebase.

Once you've completed the refactoring, you can submit a link to your forked repository as part of the task.
